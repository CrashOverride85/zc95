/* Audio3 mode
 *  Attempt to process audio in a vaguely similar way to the Audio3 mode of a 312b box. 
 * 
 * Basic approach:
 *  - Every time the audio signal cross zero, trigger a pulse (but limit to one pulse every 4ms, so 250Hz)
 *  - Change the output power based on volume. Use the difference between min and max value over a 341 sample capture as the volume
 * 
 * Complicating factors:
 *  - Audio is captured via DMA in blocks of about 341 (1/3 of 1024) samples per channel, therefore by the time this class gets the
 *    audio data, the first sample is going to be around 16ms old (at best)
 *  
 *  - This processing is happening on core0, which deals with the UI and, well, most things. So the delay between these processing 
 *    functions is going to vary a bit. However, we know fairly accurately when then the capture finished, and how long it was. 
 *    So we can use that information to effectively schedule pulses to happen 20ms after the audio event that caused it. The downside 
 *    is that this introduces 20ms of latency.
 *    These scheduled pulses get picked up by core1 which has almost nothing else to do, so jitter should be kept down.
